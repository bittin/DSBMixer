				  ABOUT

DSBMixer is a tabbed Qt (GTK+) mixer for FreeBSDÂ®. For each installed mixer
device, DSBMixer opens a tab. It adds a new mixer tab at runtime when you
plug in an USB sound device. DSBMixer allows you set amplification, to select
recording sources, and to choose your default audio device.
